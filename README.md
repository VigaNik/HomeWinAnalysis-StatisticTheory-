## Project Overview
The Home Win Analysis project aims to study the psikologekl factor of home games that contribute to the likelihood of a home team winning in various competitions. We use statistical tests like the Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon test and others, and machine learning method: linear regression to explore the data.

## Data
The dataset  consists of match results, including:
- `home win`: Whether the home team won the game (1 for win, 0 for loss/draw).
- `away win`: Whether the away team won.
- `difference`: Goal differences in each game.
  

Additional data includes goal scorers, match dates, and locations.
